        <h3 class="A2" style="font-size: 18px;">A word from King Salman bin Abdulaziz: Praise be to God,<br> who has legislated religion for us, and has made performing righteous deeds one of the most important<br> ways of bringing us closer to Him, Glory be to Him. And may blessings and peace be upon the illiterate Prophet, <br>to whom there is no charitable work that he precedes, calling the nation to, so that whoever <br>obeys him will win the approval of the Lord, Glory be to Him. And come. <br>There is no doubt that social solidarity among Muslims is a feature of this religion, which is distinguished <br>from all religions and customs by its tolerance and generosity.</h3>
